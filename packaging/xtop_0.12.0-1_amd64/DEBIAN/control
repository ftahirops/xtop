Description: Incident-first root-cause analysis console for Linux
 xtop is a terminal-based system monitor that goes beyond traditional
 tools like htop by correlating signals across CPU, memory, IO, network,
 and cgroups to produce ranked root-cause hypotheses with evidence and
 confidence scores.
 .
 Instead of showing raw metrics, xtop answers: What is the bottleneck?
 Who is causing it? How confident are we? What should I do?
 .
 Key features:
  - PSI (Pressure Stall Information) pressure tracking
  - Cgroup-aware throttling and limit detection
  - Evidence-based RCA with confidence scoring
  - eBPF probes: off-CPU, IO latency, lock contention, TCP retransmits
  - Sentinel probes: always-on BPF monitoring (drops, resets, OOM, throttle)
  - Watchdog: auto-triggered deep probes on RCA bottleneck detection
  - Per-PID syscall dissection and socket IO attribution (watchdog)
  - DiskGuard: filesystem space monitor with auto-contain (SIGSTOP/SIGCONT)
  - Causal chain reconstruction
  - Anomaly onset tracking
  - Incident recording and replay
  - Markdown incident reports for tickets
  - Doctor: comprehensive health checks with alert dispatch and watch mode
  - Shell widget: system health in bash/zsh prompt
  - Server identity discovery with confidence-based role classification
  - Interactive discover mode: service criticality, role tuning, threshold profiles
  - Beginner mode: plain-English health summary for non-ops users
  - Explain side panel: per-page metric glossary with thresholds
